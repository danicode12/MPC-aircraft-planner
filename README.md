# MPC-Based Aircraft Trajectory Planner

This project implements a **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**-based aircraft trajectory planner with realistic aviation constraints.  
It will evolve in phases, starting from simple vertical climb control and extending to full trajectory planning with wind forecasts.

## ðŸš€ Project Roadmap (hopefully and ideally) - Check them off as you go

- **Phase 1 â€“ Vertical Climb MPC**  
  Model altitude & vertical speed (`h, hÌ‡`), input is vertical acceleration.  
  Task: climb from 10,000 â†’ 30,000 ft smoothly, subject to climb rate limits.

- **Phase 2 â€“ Lateral Waypoint Tracking**  
  2D kinematic aircraft model (`x, y, Ïˆ`) with constant speed.  
  Input: bank angle â†’ turn rate. Task: follow waypoints smoothly with bank â‰¤ 30Â°.

- **Phase 3 â€“ Rolling Horizon (Real-Time MPC)**  
  Solve MPC at each step, apply first input, re-plan under disturbances (crosswind).

- **Phase 4 â€“ Integration with Prediction**  
  Add simulated wind forecasts and show how prediction improves planning.

- **Phase 5 â€“ Packaging**  
  Visualization (matplotlib/folium), polished repo, demo video.
